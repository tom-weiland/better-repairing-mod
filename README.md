# About This Mod

When's the last time you repaired your gear using an anvil? Probably not since the Mending enchantment was added to the game in 2016.

Repairing items with an anvil sucks. Mending is a band-aid solution which makes Minecraft less fun. This mod reworks these systems in an attempt to address my issues with them, while trying to keep the Vanilla feel. Importantly, it can be used on servers *without* requiring players to also install it on their end!

## Changes to Anvil Repairing (And Renaming)

1. **NEVER AGAIN have an anvil tell you it's "too expensive"!**

   You invest too heavily in acquiring your fully enchanted gear for the game to just not allow you to repair it anymore, especially at an arbitrary cost threshold and regardless of whether or not you actually have the theoretically required amount of levels. Now you can repair your gear indefinitely, and you don't need [the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil_mechanics#Planning_the_enchanting_order) or external tools to figure out the optimally efficient way to combine your enchantments.
   
2. **Repair cost no longer increases each time you repair the same item.**

   Instead, the number of enchantments an item has will affect how many xp levels it takes to repair it. This way the repair cost remains fixed and in your control, which could make for some interesting decisions about whether that extra enchantment is really necessaryâ€”maybe you'd rather not have Fortune III on your primary digging pickaxe to save yourself some levels when repairing it ðŸ¤”

3. **Cost of combining enchanted items is now based on the total number of enchantments on the item and the number of new enchantment levels being added.**

   This is easier to understand than Minecraft's default "prior work penalty" system, and also means you don't need to consult the wiki, a flow chart, or an external tool to determine the cheapest way of getting all your enchantments onto an item.

4. **Renaming an item only ever costs 1 level.**

   Renaming cost is no longer affected by the number of enchantments an item has or how often you've repaired it.

## Changes to Mending

1. **Mending no longer repairs gear using xp.**

   Minecraft's default Mending behaviour is incredibly overpowered and has many downsides:
    - It makes the anvil repair system entirely obsolete. This is in fact the primary reason for its existenceâ€”to circumvent the anvil's bad repair mechanics.
    - It makes diamonds nearly worthless once you've got a full set of gear.
    - The most consistent way of acquiring it involves mindlessly placing a lectern next to a villager (whom you've probably enslaved and locked in a small box/hole) over and over and over and over again until you finally get lucky. Boooooring! And *SO* tedious ðŸ¥±
    - The second most consistent way of acquiring it involves fishing for long periods of time or building an AFK fish farm. Sounds unappealing enough that I've never even bothered.
    - Once you have it, the most efficient way to mend your tools all the way is to sit in front of an xp farm. Also incredibly unexciting.
    - Armor effectively becomes unbreakable because you're wearing it, meaning xp will always repair it (unlike tools which are only repaired by xp if you are holding them), and situations where your armor takes more damage than the xp you collect can repair are virtually non-existent.
   
2. **Mending now reduces the repair cost (levels) for repairing gear in an anvil and increases the durability regained per repair.**

   Since this mod fixes the main problems with the anvil repair system, Mending no longer needs to exist as a substitute and can be repurposed. It now makes repairing your gear cheaper and more efficientâ€”less materials are required to fully repair an item and each repair costs less levels. This takes Mending from a critical enchantment that you *must* have on all of your gear no matter how tedious it is to acquire, to an optional (but still useful) enchantment.

   Maybe now you'll arrive at that end city and actually have a use for the Mending items you find because you didn't bother getting fully decked out in it quite yet!
